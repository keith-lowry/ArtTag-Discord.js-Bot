# ArtTag-Discord.js-Bot
Discord.js bot for storing art image links from various websites, along with emote reactions as tags. Art links will be queried and viewed using these tags.

### Concept
Users that post images or links that embed an image in a discord channel that the bot has access to will be able to have the bot save and associate that image with a particular emote by adding an emote reaction to the image message. Images that have been "tagged" with a particular emote can later be viewed in an image gallery embed by using a special slash-command that provides the desired emote. The image gallery can be clicked through to view each image tagged with the given emote from most recent to least recent.

The goal of this bot is to provide a tagging function such that a discord server in which art is frequently posted can sort of organize and retrieve images quickly.

###  Tools
- PostgreSQL for Link Database
- Discord.js Discord API wrapper
- Javascript (duh)

*Yes I know this is no fancy README at the moment, but be assured that this will get updated to be nicer once the bot actually has some nice functionality. Class work for my systems class and other life things have kept me busy recently, but I want to finish this and it should not take too long. Working front-end connected to back-end eta May 2024.*
